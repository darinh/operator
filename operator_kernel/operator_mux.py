"""Session-backend abstraction for the Copilot operator.

Owns every terminal-multiplexer invocation. Nothing else in the toolkit shells
out to tmux/psmux directly, which keeps the backend replaceable and keeps the
platform-divergent behavior auditable in one place.

Backends
--------
tmux    Linux, macOS, WSL
psmux   Windows (ships `tmux`, `pmux`, `psmux` as identical aliases)

Verified psmux divergences from tmux (psmux 3.3.7)
--------------------------------------------------
1. A session name containing ':' produces exit code 0 but creates NO session.
   A success-shaped failure is the most dangerous kind, so `new_session` always
   verifies with `has_session` afterwards and raises when the session is absent.
2. '.' is preserved rather than rewritten to '_' as tmux does. Sanitizing both
   characters keeps names identical across platforms.
3. `list-sessions` exits 0 with empty output when no server is running, whereas
   tmux exits 1. Emptiness is therefore detected from output, never exit status.

Server-lifecycle race (tmux, all platforms)
-------------------------------------------
The server exits once its last session is killed, and shutdown is not
instantaneous. A `new-session` issued inside that window connects to a socket
whose server is already leaving and fails with "server exited unexpectedly"
even though the request was perfectly valid. Restarting a loop immediately
after the previous one ended hits this in production, not only in tests, so
`new_session` retries the transient signatures rather than surfacing them.
