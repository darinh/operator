"""Who invoked the operator, and from where.

``operator.log`` records what the operator *did*. It has never recorded who
asked, and on 2026-08-03 that gap cost an evening: every loop on the machine
gave up within nine seconds of the others, and the log could say only that
five unrelated projects had each exited unexpectedly five times. Nothing in it
distinguished a human typing ``operator stop`` from an agent shelling out to
``operator send`` from a third-party supervisor restarting the world. The
answer turned out to be visible in the process tree the whole time -- the
loops were being started by a launcher nobody had thought to look for -- but
the process tree is gone the moment the process is, and the log kept none of
it.

This module writes one JSON line per invocation to ``~/.operator/trace.jsonl``
naming the argv, the working directory, and the *source*: a user at a
terminal, an agent inside a Copilot session, the operator's own background
supervisor, or something external. It is deliberately a separate file from
``operator.log``: that log is read by humans watching a run, and one line per
CLI call would drown it.

Three rules shape everything here.

**Tracing must never be able to break the operator.** This runs at the top of
every invocation, including the supervisor that keeps unattended sessions
alive. A tracer that raises would take down the thing it exists to
investigate, so every public function swallows its own failures and the
recorder degrades to writing nothing. That is the one place in this repo where
losing an answer silently is the right trade -- but see the next rule for what
it is not allowed to do.

**"Could not tell" never collapses into an answer.** The ancestry walk returns
``None`` when the process tree could not be read, never ``[]``: an empty list
means "this process has no recorded ancestors", which is a claim, and a false
one. Likewise :func:`classify` reports ``unknown`` rather than guessing
``user``. This module is instrumentation for a failure that was invisible
precisely because a missing observation read as a normal one, and reproducing
that shape inside the fix would be its own punchline.

**Nothing here interprets the trace.** No heuristic decides which launcher is
legitimate, because the launcher that mattered on 2026-08-03 was one no
list would have contained. The classifier reports what it observed and names
the executable; a human reads the file and draws the conclusion.

    This is the event the trace was built for and the one an invocation log
    cannot see. When seven loops died together on 2026-08-03 no operator
    command was run at all -- each supervisor was already inside its poll
    loop, so there was nothing to attribute. ``operator.log`` said "copilot
    exited unexpectedly" seven times and could say nothing else, because the
    supervisor never waits on the child: it polls liveness, and a process that
    is gone leaves no exit code behind to read.

    So "unexpected" here means only *unexplained* -- no stop, detach or
    restart marker was set. It is not evidence of a crash, and the distinction
    matters: the copilot logs for that incident end with an orderly
    ``[shutdown] Shutdown complete``, and the extensions died with
    ``0xC000013A`` (``STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT``), which is a console control
    event delivered to every process sharing the console rather than a fault
    in any one session. What is recorded here is therefore the observation and
    the marker states it was judged against, so a later reader can re-judge
    it. Nothing here decides what killed the session.

    Endings that *were* explained are recorded too, and that is not a cosmetic
    addition: for a long time only the unexplained branch called this, so
    every record carried ``restart=False`` and the trace could be read -- was
    read -- as proving no session had ever ended by handoff. A population that
    excludes the cases you are trying to count cannot answer the question, and
    it does not look empty while failing to.

    ``code`` fingerprints the operator source the *supervisor* is running, so
    a later reader can scope a re-measurement to records from an instrument
    that had a given fix. Scoping by date cannot do this: a supervisor keeps
    the code it imported at startup, so records dated after a fix are still
    written by supervisors without it.
