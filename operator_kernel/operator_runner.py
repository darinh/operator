"""In-pane supervisor for a single Copilot session.

The multiplexer launches this module, not Copilot directly. It exists to solve
two defects that cannot be fixed from the operator process:

1. **Process identity.** On POSIX the generated run script ends in
   `exec copilot`, so the multiplexer's pane PID *is* Copilot's PID. Windows has
   no `exec`: the measured process tree is
   `pane_pid -> pwsh -> run script -> copilot`, so the pane PID identifies the
   multiplexer's own shell. Because Copilot names its telemetry log
   `process-{startMs}-{pid}.log`, PID-based lookup silently fails there, which
   both disables `--resume` and lets concurrent instances attribute each other's
   usage. The runner spawns Copilot itself, so it knows the real PID.

   Even the spawned PID is not always the right one: on Windows the launcher is
   often a *shim* that re-execs the real binary as a child under a different
   pid. WinGet installs `copilot.exe` as such a shim, and virtualenv
   `python.exe` behaves the same way. The runner therefore matches the log
   against the whole process tree it created, and pins the file while that tree
   is still alive.

2. **Supervision across detach.** The operator prints "metrics will be captured
   when copilot exits" and then exits, so on detach nothing remained to capture
   them. The runner lives inside the pane and outlives detach, so it performs
   the capture itself.

State written to the instance state directory:

``{id}.pid``      Copilot's real process id, removed on exit
``{id}.session``  Copilot CLI session UUID, once discovered
``{id}.exit``     Exit code, written as soon as Copilot terminates and before
                  metrics capture -- see :func:`run` for why the ordering is
                  load-bearing rather than incidental

A malformed launch spec exits ``EXIT_BAD_SPEC`` and is still reported through
those files: see :func:`_load_spec`.

    # This file is two things at once: the signal that ends the supervisor's
    # poll, and the only durable record of *how* the session ended. In the
    # system this kernel is extracted from, it was written *after* a metrics
    # capture that parsed the harness's debug log, and the cost was measured
    # rather than imagined. Across every `*.runner.log` on that machine, 11
    # exits reached the capture: the gap between the child's death and the
    # marker ran from 7s to **47947s (13.3 hours)**, averaging 95 minutes. For
    # one session the two logs agree to the second -- `copilot exited
    # rc=3221225477` at 18:20:38, and the supervisor did not notice until
    # 18:46:33. A supervised agent was dead for 26 minutes with nothing
    # relaunching it, and that was the *good* case, where the runner survived.
    #
    # The evidence cost was worse than the delay. The exit code is the single
    # fact separating "the agent crashed on its own" from "something took the
    # whole pane" -- and 10 of those 11 read 3221225477 (0xC0000005), which is
    # the former. Anything killing the runner inside that window destroyed it,
    # so of 1042 recorded endings exactly **3** carried an exit code. A crash
    # and an external kill were filed identically, because the discriminator
    # was queued behind a log parse.
    #
    # The metrics capture that used to follow is not in this kernel at all --
    # it was the only thing tying supervision to the ingest subsystem, and
    # `tests/test_kernel_boundary.py` refuses its return. Publishing the marker
    # is now the last thing `run` does, so there is nothing left to queue
    # behind.
    #
    # Tolerant of its own failure: an unwritable state directory should cost
    # the marker, not the process.
