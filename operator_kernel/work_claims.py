"""One work item, one owner: the claim store behind ``operator work``.

A claim records *which instance is working what*, and the runtime identity of
that instance at the moment it claimed -- boot id, mux session, pid and the
pid's start time. Those four are not bookkeeping: they are what
:mod:`operator_liveness` reads to decide whether a claim's owner is provably
gone, and a claim written without them can only ever be judged by its
heartbeat, which is the one signal the spec refuses to act on alone.

**Keyed by the work item, with the owner recorded.** The predecessor keyed the
row by ``agent_id UNIQUE``, which answers "what is this agent doing" and
cannot answer "who has this item" without a scan -- and the second question is
the one a reclaim asks. The item is the primary key here; ``instance`` carries
its own UNIQUE constraint because an agent holds at most one item at a time
(spec D6). Batching is deliberately *not* designed for: allowing a set now
means designing release and reclaim for a shape nobody has needed.

Nothing in this module judges liveness or steals a claim. :func:`reassign` is
a compare-and-swap on the *current* owner, so the caller has to have decided
who that is and to have been right; the policy that decides -- and the
`wip/` commit that must precede it -- lives with ``operator work reclaim``.

    write rather than overwriting whatever is there now. Deciding that the
    old owner is gone is :mod:`operator_liveness`'s job, and preserving that
    owner's uncommitted work is ``operator work reclaim``'s -- this function
    is only the last, atomic step.

    id or a moved worktree all refuse. It is optional so that a caller with no
    prior read (there is none today, but the signature outlives that) is not
    forced to invent one.
