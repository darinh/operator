"""Is the agent holding this claim still there? -- and the honest "I cannot tell".

Four signals, cheapest first, exactly as the spec's FR-3 orders them:

1. **Boot id differs** -> DEAD. The unplanned-reboot case, and it costs no
   timeout at all: nothing from the previous boot is running, so there is
   nothing to wait for.
2. **Mux session absent** -> DEAD. Direct and exact, because every agent runs
   inside one.
3. **Pid absent, or present with a different start time** -> DEAD. The
   start-time comparison is what makes this safe after pid reuse; without it
   a recycled pid reads as its dead predecessor still running.
4. **Heartbeat older than ``stale_after``, with 1-3 having concluded nothing**
   -> STALE. Reported, never acted on. This combination means something
   unusual -- a hung process, a clock that moved -- and guessing is how two
   agents end up in one worktree.

The first three are conclusive; the fourth deliberately is not. So every probe
here is **tri-state**: ``True``, ``False``, or ``None`` for *could not tell*.
A probe that answers "absent" when it means "I could not look" is the whole
failure mode this module exists to avoid -- it does not lose a session, it
hands a live agent's tree to somebody else while the first is still writing
to it.

Nothing here mutates anything. :func:`assess` reads; ``operator work reclaim``
decides, and only for :data:`DEAD`.
