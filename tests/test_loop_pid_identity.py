"""A pid is not an identity, and `looping` must not be a recycled pid.

Backlog 0029. `_running_loop_pid` decided a supervisor was alive by asking
whether *some* process held the pid in `{instance}.loop.pid`. Windows recycles
pids aggressively, so once a supervisor died, any unrelated process later
handed its pid made the file read as live -- and `operator list` printed that
instance as `looping`, with a session number and an age, byte-identical to a
healthy row. That is backlog 0001's failure shape: the instrument reports the
machine as fine at exactly the moment it is not.

It also gated everything downstream. `_instance_summary` and `list_instances`
only say anything about staleness, an unrecorded record, a mismatched one or a
supervisor restart when `snap["loop_pid"]` is truthy, so a false positive kept
four notices switched on for a supervisor that could not be described, and a
false negative would switch all four off at once -- which is why every test
below that pins a *fallback* matters as much as the ones that pin a refusal.
