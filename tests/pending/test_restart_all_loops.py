"""`operator restart-loop --all`, and the notices that send people to it.

An operator change makes every supervisor on the machine stale at the same
instant -- they each imported their code once, at startup. So the per-instance
restart is the exception and the sweep is the normal case, and for a while it
was the other way round: `operator list` named eight stale supervisors and
printed eight commands to type. A remedy applied by hand once per instance is
a remedy applied to some of them.
